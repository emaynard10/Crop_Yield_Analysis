# Crop_Yield_Analysis
Columbia University final group project

## Topic Selection
### Our group selected the topic of crop yield, which is based on different factors such as the rain fall, temperature, pesticides. Agriculture is a critical role in the global economy and understanding can help solve global challenges, such as food security and reducing impact of climate change. We were interested in the crop yield data and wanted to determine what conditions create the best crop yield and which conditions have a higher effect on which countries yield the most crops for the year. The data source is from Kaggle
